## Processor Example
This Processor Example uses a Mock API Endpoint created in  Apiary.io to emulate a Vendor API and show how would be implemented, in the basic use-cases, a Connect processor using the Connect Processor Template for Python project. 
Apiary.io is a tool to design, prototype, document, and test APIs. You can read more about Apiary API design tool in our Community Portal: https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/sdk/vendor-scenario-example/apiary-api-design-tool/.
The Mock API created in Apiary.io to be used in this Processor Example is https://vendorexample.docs.apiary.io/#

This processor has implemented the following use cases:
1. Purchase
2. Cancel
3. Suspend
4. Resume
5. Change
